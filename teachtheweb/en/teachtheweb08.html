<h2>Planning Week 8 Make it Real</h2>
<p><b>Week 8 </b><strong>is about taking things offline and Making it Real.</strong><br>

<p>Now that we’ve tried to teach using our materials, we should be thinking about how to improve those materials and make things better. We’re also in a good position to think about making the last seven weeks of #teachtheweb the beginning of our participation in Maker Party, a three month long celebration of making, learning together, the open ethos and all things web.</p>
<p>This week, we’ll be thinking about our individual contexts and how we might bring the joy of the web to more people in our community. How can we spread the open ethos in our daily lives? What kind of time can we commit to to Make it Real in our cities, towns and communities?</p>
<p><b>Contribute a make: </b>Make a popcorn video about how a Maker Party in your local area would be unique. Or make and share documentation from another event you’ve done where you wanted to #teachtheweb</p>
<p>If you need help, or want to feedback on this process, post to the <a href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker">G+ Community</a>!</p>
