<strong>Week 3: the Open Web</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MAKE Project this week:</strong> Find someone to collaborate with and create a make about why being open is important to you.</p>
<p>Plan your makes with your collaborator and then do it! If you’re in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al0Wg7eR7tHcdDRGVEJCMEFXbmRwV3RUamhHRVlfRHc#gid=0" target="_blank">a study group</a>, you’re encouraged to work together around your topic. Share your makes with <a href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker" target="_blank">the #teachtheweb community</a>.<span id="more-332"></span></p>
<p>Two weeks ago we began the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&amp;src=typd">#teachtheweb</a> experience by taking a look at “<a href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/week-1-making-as-learning/">Making as Learning</a>“. We zeroed in on digital making with a project on introductions, which we built using web tools. In Week 2, we used those projects to explore the idea of “<a href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/week-2-connected-learning-in-practice/">Connected Learning in Practice</a>“. As we riffed off each others work and began remixing each others ideas, we began to have a deeper conversation about being connected through technology, implications of our online versus offline identities and what those things mean for learning.</p>
<p>This week, we’re going to take a look at <strong>how important the Open Web is in supporting connected learning and making in the digital space</strong>. We’ll explore what it means to work openly and how it can influence learning.</p>
<p>When we talk about “openness”, there are a variety of things that come to mind. We can view openness i) through the lens of copyright/copyleft, ii) through the technical structures that make a webpage open or not, iii) through the cultural practices the Open Community prides itself on, and so on. The term openness is a confluence of technical, cultural and social definitions that can get meta pretty quickly.</p>
<h4><strong>Tenets of Openness</strong></h4>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 2454px"><img scale="0" alt="Open Web? Freedome, participation, decentralization, generativity" src="http://commonspace.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/open-web-1-of-1.jpg" height="1092" width="2444"><p class="wp-caption-text">A Mark Surman Doodle</p></div>
<p>Nevertheless, there are several tenets of openness that apply to the technical implementation as well as the social and cultural usage of the Web:</p>
<p>The first is <strong>decentralization</strong>. The Open Web is made up of thousands and thousands of independent servers and webpages. The networked computers that make up the Internet are not owned by any single entity. Additionally, webpages are created and maintained by millions of people. Decentralization in the social and cultural space is inherent in the Open Web.</p>
<p>Another tenet is <strong>transparency</strong>. You can see how any webpage is built, you can copy a webpages code and duplicate and/or remix it to be your own by viewing its source code. Furthermore, the culture of Open is one that transparent about processes, creations and authors. We make media and write posts about our work. We ask questions and allow anyone to feedback on them through commenting and social media. We change things based on what our peers say, and we explain our decisions openly, so that everyone can see not only what we’ve done, but how and why. We iterate on our ideas based on the feedback we receive from our peers.</p>
<p>With decentralization and transparency comes the tenet of <strong>hackability</strong>. The Open Web is a structure that makes remix and redistribution easy, and the culture that lives by these tenets takes pride in extending, changing and reforming each other’s work. Because we can see how things are built, we can change them and apply new meaning and context atop someone else’s ideas. We start to have a conversation through production, and that is something that is supported by and encouraged through the Open Web and Open Culture.</p>
<h4><strong>Ownership and Authorship</strong></h4>

<p><strong>A remix creates a derivative work from an original.</strong> In the web context, remix is used to imply that a new work is built off an already established base. That “base” work might be a code base, a curriculum base, an image base, a text base, etc.</p>
<p>What’s important about ideas and creation in an open context is making sure that credit is given where credit is due. Since we all influence each other, <strong>it’s important to make note of who influences your work and how.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s explore open collaboration together.</strong> Below are some ideas on how you might explore the Open Web through making. This short blog post barely scratches the surface of what the Open Web is or why it should be protected. Below are a variety of readings that will help you <strong>delve deeper into the idea of “openness” and why it’s important.</strong></p>
<p><strong>MAKE Projects this week:</strong><br>
Last week in #teachtheweb, we explored “<a href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/week-2-connected-learning-in-practice/">Connected Learning in Practice</a>” by remixing other people’s work to create a conversation through makes. This week, we’ll work together to make things, and we’ll use the openness of the Web to do so.</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="Live Chat" href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker" target="_blank">Find someone to collaborate with</a> and create a make about <strong>why being open is important</strong> to you. Plan your makes with your collaborator and then do it! If you’re in a study group, you’re encouraged to work together around your topic. Share your makes with the #teachtheweb community.</li>
<li>Explore your peers’ remixes from last week and choose one to <strong>make a mashup</strong> with. Make a webpage to juxtapose their work with your own, and write a blurb about how the two works relate. Then share it to as many online channels as possible.</li>
<li>Review the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/" target="_blank">Creative Commons licenses</a> and choose one to add to the footer of your blog or on your other works.</li>
