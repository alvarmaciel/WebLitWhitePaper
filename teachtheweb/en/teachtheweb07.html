<strong>Week 7: Playtesting</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MAKE Project this week:</strong> <strong>Try out your activities</strong> from last week on friends, family members or group of learners, then create a make (or several makes) that reflects on that experience. What went right? What went wrong? Did your learners learn something? What would you change? Were all of your learning goals addressed? Were there other skills/competencies your learner acquired that you hadn’t thought of? Etc! <strong>Share your playtest and reflection</strong> with the <a href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker">#teachtheweb community</a>.<span id="more-459"></span></p>
<p><strong>Thousands of people across the globe are looking to us to help them make something awesome.</strong> During <a href="http://webmaker.org/party" target="_blank">Maker Party</a>, in workshops, code-a-thons, teen tech bashes, father-daughter hack jams or just simple <a href="http://youmedia.org/node/120/research/homago-essentials" target="_blank">HOMAGO</a> sessions, we have an opportunity to teach the world about open culture, web skills and the amazing experience of defining your own learning paths.</p>
<p><a title="Week 6: Peers Working in the Open" href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/week-6-peers-working-in-the-open/" target="_blank">Last week</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#teachtheweb</a> we looked at how open collaboration and constructive criticism from our peers helps us iterate on our work. There have also been several conversations during the #teachtheweb experience that have helped us see how our roles as mentors are changing. In week 7, we’ll see that shifting dynamic again as we use playtesting to gather feedback and reflection from our learners.</p>
<h4><strong>What is playtesting?</strong></h4>
<p>Playtesting is a method of quality control that reveals design flaws, complications, misunderstandings and missed steps. It’s been used in the gaming industry for years, and our open community has adopted the term to supplement “User Testing”. Using the term “playtest” instead of “user test” is a way of indicating that quality control can be fun and that <a title="Week 5: Webmaking as Learning" href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/webmaking-as-learning/" target="_blank">Webmaking as Learning</a> is a good way to surface the playful spirit that learning experiences should have. Playtesting comes back to agency as it allows learners to help design their own learning paths. <strong>Playtesting is a step in co-designing with your audience, and it’s a reflective activity for that audience.</strong></p>
<p>In the Mozilla universe, <strong>we believe in the idea that co-designing things with the people we’re designing them for.</strong> It leads to more effective, interesting and appropriate learning opportunities. Instead of keeping our ideas behind closed doors, trying to perfect them before sharing, we say (a variation of) <strong>“Just ship it!”</strong> We put things into the world, allow people to play around with them, and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>We playtest as we go</strong>, then we go back and iterate our makes, ideas, lessons, activities and so on based on the user’s feedback. Last week, we did this online by asking our peers to take some time to give feedback. This week, we’ll ask learners what they think of the things we’ve been making.</p>
<h4><strong>No plan survives contact with the user.</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The answer to “What works best?” is ultimately a question that you and your audience have to work out together.</strong> It can be quite scary to playtest half-baked ideas and creations we’ve never shown our actual audience. However, playtesting allows us to gather the valuable perspectives of our own audience. Sometimes, you’ll find an audience you didn’t mean to find. Sometimes you’ll discover that you’ve missed the mark and have to start again.</p>
<p>Because each person has a unique perspective that often leads to rethinking concepts, ideas or educational resources, shipping often means that we can work faster. We can integrate new ideas and then test that integration. Then we can rinse and repeat. <strong>Useful, constructive feedback drives trust and community; to sustain a community of webmakers, it’s important for users to have the ability to gift feedback to authors.</strong></p>
<p>As you share your makes, resources and projects, watch your user’s reactions and ask yourself things like:<br>
<strong>Is the user:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>following the instructions?</li>
<li>getting the joke?</li>
<li>understanding the commentary?</li>
<li>having fun?</li>
</ul>
<p>Help learners give you good feedback by making it easy for them. You can ask them to finish sentences like:</p>
<ul>
<li>I thought you did a nice job with/of ___.</li>
<li>You might want to improve ___.</li>
<li>Your idea was fun/interesting because ___.</li>
<li>What you made was ___ and it made me think/feel ____.</li>
</ul>
<p>When they’re finished with their reviews, ask them what next steps would be. How can what you’ve show them/done with them/made with them be improved upon?</p>
<p>Practically speaking, if you don’t have a regular meetup or classroom where you’re already engaging your audience, <strong>playtesting in the real world might seem difficult. It doesn’t have to be.</strong> A playtesting session can be designed as an informal <a href="https://webmaker.org/en-US/events/guides/kitchen-table/" target="_blank">kitchen table party</a> where you can practice how to #teachtheweb. <strong>Playtesting your ideas with a group of friends or relatives is a great way to push your thinking to the next level.</strong></p>
<p>The important thing about these next weeks of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23teachtheweb&amp;src=typd" target="_blank">#teachtheweb</a> is to understand how the topics and themes we’ve explored thus far relate to our real worlds and daily lives. <strong>Playtesting will allow us to learn from our successes and failures. We can then improve our resources based on practical experience.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>MAKE Projects this Week</strong></h4>
<p><strong>MAKE Project this week:</strong> <strong>Try out your activities</strong> from last week on friends, family members or group of learners, then create a make (or several makes) that reflects on that experience. What went right? What went wrong? Did your learners learn something? What would you change? Were all of your learning goals addressed? Were there other skills/competencies your learner acquired that you hadn’t thought of? Etc!<strong> Share your playtest and reflection</strong> with the <a href="http://mzl.la/gpluswebmaker" target="_blank">#teachtheweb community</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other suggested makes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exquisite_corpse" target="_blank">exquisite corpse</a> make and iterate on it collaboratively</li>
<li><strong>Send 5 people feedback</strong> and create a Storify or other artifact (HTML pad, etherpad, blogpost, etc) of your QA process.</li>
<li>Make a <a href="http://storify.com" target="_blank">Storify</a> or other artifact of your revision processes this week as feedback rolls in to you.</li>
<li><strong>Make a contributor/play-tester <a href="http://badges.mozilla.org" target="_blank">badge</a></strong> to send each person who sends you impactful feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Reflection </strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Who do you imagine your audience to be? Can you reach them in #teachtheweb? How can #teachtheweb help you reach them elsewhere? With whom do you most need to playtest your work?</li>
<li>How can your #teachtheweb work connect to the rest of your calling?</li>
<li>How is #teachtheweb a playtest for expanding your teaching?</li>
<li>How do we situate what we’ve learned about web authoring and teaching the web in our work with other learners?</li>
<li>How can you help your audience and yourself cultivate the awareness to identify and report on “bugs” in teaching and learning?</li>
<li>Why does encouraging feedback from your audience lead to improved learning design?</li>
</ul>
