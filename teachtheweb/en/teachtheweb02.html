<p><strong>Last week we explored “Making as Learning”.</strong> We’re proponents of the idea that people learn best through making, but we also believe that making and learning are social activities. It’s a bit like the old idiom “If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?” If you make and learn, but don’t share and gather feedback, have you really learned? How do other people’s <strong>perceptions influence</strong> how we understand the world around us? How does being connected change the very fabric of our world?</p>

<p>A lot of people are thinking about how to connect learning. Last year, MacArthur Foundation’s Digital Media and Learning Initiative released a new learning model called <a href="http://dmlcentral.net/press/2012-02/researchers-introduce-new-model-learning-connected-learning-designed-‘mine-new-social" target="_blank">“Connected Learning”</a>. This model proposes a framework for organizations and individuals to collaborate in an openly networked way and to take advantage of changes in technology and connectivity.</p>
<p><a href="http://connectedlearning.tv/infographic"><img scale="0" title="Connected Learning" alt="Connected Learning" src="http://connectedlearning.tv/sites/connectedlearning.tv/files/DG_Macarthur_r03-960_0.jpeg"></a></p>
<p><strong>These principles state that education in the modern world needs to be:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interest-powered</strong> – the researchers state that <strong>“learners who are interested in what they are learning, achieve higher order learning outcomes.”</strong> This requirement brings a certain degree of relevance to educational models. Organizations that follow the connected learning principles create programming that allows the learner to explore their own interests.</li>
<li><strong>Peer-supported</strong> – Connected learning also has an element of <strong>socialization as a required function in learning</strong>. Allowing learners to interact with each other and teach each other in various forms of group work helps learners make connections not only with the materials they’re learning, but with their peers as well. Creating learning spaces where peer to peer learning is encouraged leads to deeper cultural exploration and understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Academically oriented</strong> – The third principle proposed by the Connected Learning Model proposes that <strong>academic success is an important underpinning for intellectual growth.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The Connected Learning model further describes design principles and values for modern education that have their beginnings in the philosophical ideas and information presented during the Reform Pedagogy and Progressive Education movements.</p>
<p>A connection between the theories circulating at the end of the 19th century and those educational theorists are calling for as a solution to problems existing in the modern educational landscape are not very different from one another. The revival of an interest project-based approach to all educational endeavors is at the heart of the “Making as Learning” approach.</p>
<p><a href="http://connectedlearning.tv/connected-learning-principles" target="_blank">Read more about the Connected Learning Model here.</a></p>
<h4><strong>But what does this mean IN PRACTICE?</strong></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bennychandra/8551806799/"><img scale="0" class=" " alt="" src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8551806799_f46bf89864_z.jpg"></a></p>
<p>There are a variety of networks that seek to put these principles and values into practice. Connected Learning is an innovative way of creating peer groups from different parts of world for the sake of learning &amp; sharing knowledge, so all over the world groups of people and organizations are beginning to use the model to help them design learning opportunities for their local communities.</p>
<p>In NYC, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Toronto the <a href="http://hivelearningnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Hive Learning Network</a> is composed of non-profit organizations—museums, libraries, after-school clubs and informal learning spaces—that create Connected Learning opportunities for youth. <strong>These organizations have regular meetups and a designated online space where the conversation around their various initiatives never stops.</strong> In addition, these organizations share resources, partner on programs, do outreach with and for each other and share everything online, so that anyone can see what a particular Hive is up to.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://nwp.org" target="_blank">National Writing Project</a> uses partnerships and its internal network to support a variety of youth programming and educator professional development, bringing people from across the US together. <strong>More than 300 locales are connected to national NWP initiatives and partnerships</strong>, meaning that thousands of educators have access to local sites. Through their <a href="http://digitalis.nwp.org" target="_blank">Digital Is</a> site, the NWP helps educators stay connected and improve on their own practices.</p>
<p><strong>These are just two of many kindred networks that use the Connected Learning model.</strong> In these two examples, the practice of Connected Learning manifests itself both online and offline. These networks design work and learning with the idea that sharing and openness is required for connected learning, and they design their programs to take place both in the real as well as in the virtual world.</p>
<p><strong>In practice, it would seem that both hyper-local aspects as well as global connections play an important role in Connected Learning.</strong></p>
