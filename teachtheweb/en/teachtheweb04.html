<strong>Week 4: Add the Web to Anything</strong></h3>
<p><strong>MAKE Project this week:</strong> Make an overview of the learning goals and web literacy skills you’re most interested in teaching. Think about the people you want to teach and their interests. We put together<a title="Learning Goals" href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lj1k/edit" target="_blank"> this Hackable template</a> to help you think about these prompts and make a resource that your peers can give you feedback on.<span id="more-382"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/topics-and-tasks/"><strong>Welcome to the second section of #teachtheweb!</strong></a> During the amazing first three weeks, we had an Introduction to Webmaker, and explored how openness and online collaboration can help us innovate our practice and increase impact. The conversations that we’ve been having have helped us focus our thoughts around making, connectivity and the web as they relate to learning. We’ve also had the opportunity to level up a variety of skills and competencies just by taking this journey together.</p>
<p>During the next few weeks, we will go deeper into these ideas as we make, <strong>remix and contextualize</strong> educational resources. Our aim is to continue strengthening this community, sharing experiences and make some hackable, shareable resources that push the boundaries of participatory, collaborative, learner-centric learning.</p>
<p>This week, we’re exploring how to <strong>Add the Web to Anything </strong>– how to include web skills while teaching other topics. When we think of the Web, we tend to think of it as a technical and social infrastructure; a series of services that allow us to connect with one another and share digital artifacts. Many of us don’t often consider the immensity of the true fact of what the Web is:</p>
<p><strong>The Web is human knowledge documented.</strong></p>
<p>A very, very large amount of human knowledge. It’s not new for human beings to document what we know. We’ve been doing it since the invention of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_writing_ancient_numbers#Clay_tokens" target="_blank">tokens at the origin of writing</a>. What’s new are the types of skills and competencies we need to be able to understand information and each other through these machines. <strong>We have to have certain skills to make sense of it all.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>The Web Literacy Standard</strong></h4>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 759px"><img scale="0" alt="Beta Release of the Web Literacy Standard" src=" http://24.media.tumblr.com/38fefd7481f0befe47d4b2420c7403cc/tumblr_mlpl4m5H9m1s77r38o1_r1_1280.jpg" height="1024" width="749"><p class="wp-caption-text">Beta Release of the Web Literacy Standard</p></div>
<p>With the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard" target="_blank">Web Literacy Standard</a>, we’re trying to find an easy way for educators and technologists to understand these new types of learning objectives.</p>
<blockquote><p>What are the skills, competencies and literacies necessary to read, write and participate on the Web – now and in the future? We need a way to ensure we’re teaching the right things. That means exploring ways to help learners discover pathways, and of course, to find ways for us all to track our impact. <strong>That’s where the standard comes in – we can build consensus</strong> around the overall learning map and then each chart our course against it. <em>– from the #WebLitStd Community</em></p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Many of the skills and competencies included in the Web Literacy Standard are things that could easily be taught in combination with other topics.</strong> Why not kill two birds with one stone when it’s possible? As we explore new ways to educate people and try to draw lines to each learners interest, working in skills and topics that lead a learner to becoming truly educated is kind of the point.</p>
<h4><strong>We Have Agency</strong></h4>
<p>It’s important to remember that <strong>some of us are working in places that make us feel like hacking systems is not allowed</strong> or impossible. Many of us feel that we <em>have</em> to adhere to this or that policy. The question is: Is it our own misconception that makes us feel that way? Does the policy really spell out the way that we are allowed to teach? And even if it does, how can we walk the line?</p>
<p>In <a href=" http://budtheteacher.com/blog/2012/03/29/in-search-of-agency/" target="_blank">this excellent article</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/budtheteacher" target="_blank">Bud Hunt</a> talks about the agency that we have in teaching and learning. The NWP’s site <a href="http://digitalis.nwp.org/" target="_blank">Digital Is</a> explores what “digital” means for the future of teaching writing and connected learning. When we’re thinking about adding digital and web literacies into our practice, when we’re thinking about the future of learning, we should remember that <strong>we are in control of our own experiences.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s add the web to other topics and themes we want to teach.</strong> Let’s start identifying learning goals that help learners make use of and contribute to the ecosystem of human knowledge. Let’s, in the spirit of open collaboration, share our ideas around adding the web to anything and see how those ideas evolve.</p>
<h4><strong>Make Projects this Week</strong></h4>
<p><a title="Week 3: the Open Web" href="http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/week-3-the-open-web/" target="_blank">Last week</a> in #teachtheweb, we worked together to make pieces that reflected on the importance of the Open Web. This week, we’ll think about our own intentions as educators and technologists.</p>
<p><strong>MAKE Project this week:</strong> Make an overview of the learning goals and web literacy skills you’re most interested in teaching. Think about the people you want to teach and their interests. We put together<a title="Learning Goals" href="https://thimble.webmaker.org/p/lj1k/edit" target="_blank"> this Hackable template</a> to help you think about these prompts and make a resource that your peers can give you feedback on.</p>
<p><strong>Other suggested makes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Make a mindmap</strong> or use another brainstorming technique to generate a lesson plan that uses physical materials, like paper-prototyping or physical remix, together with webmaking.</li>
<li>Make <a href="http://www.mentormob.com/people/createdPlaylists/mozilla-webmaker-19554" target="_blank">a Mentor Mob playlist</a> that will help another mentor run an activity in their own environment or teach a particular topic.</li>
<li><strong> Hack an open educational resource</strong> to include web skills. Show the iterations you went through (i.e. show us version 1, version 2 and so on.)</li>
<li>Make a list of crafty materials a mentor could use for <strong>physical webmaking lessons</strong>, and explain what they might be used for.</li>
<li>Tell your peers how you’ve hacked a curriculum/textbook/support manual to meet your needs. What are ways that you’ve exercised agency within a seemingly restricted lock-step system?</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Reflection</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>How can we create hacked resources that are easily remixable? What sort of tools can facilitate this?</li>
<li>How can you adapt a resource and open it to your learners? How can you hack your learning space to inspire more open learning?</li>
<li>How can you adapt/hack your practice into the open?</li>
<li>Explore how hacking leads to learning. When hacking, what worked well? What didn’t? and what did you learn from the latter?</li>
<li>Why should we commit to adapting our teaching and learning to be the open?</li>
<li>What are possible outcomes of educational systems that don’t even know there is such a thing as programming (to borrow from Rushkoff) or as Arduinos or RPi or OER?</li>
<li>What are possible outcomes of systems that do know about these things, and how do we work towards such systems/relationships/communities?</li>
<li>What are the differences between different kinds of copyleft/open licenses? What else is there besides CC? How do these licenses deal with idea of openness and remix?</li>
<li>How can we help learners demonstrate learning by remixing content in webmaking/coding frames so that they manipulate content rather than weather its delivery?</li>
</ul>
