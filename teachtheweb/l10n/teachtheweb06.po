"to take a closer look at the idea of <strong>open collaboration</strong> and "

"We gather strength and confidence from positive feedback, just as negative "
"feedback forces us to consider whether our ideas are valid.  Reaction pushes "
"us to think about our actions, so <strong>when we work openly, we invite "
"reaction.</strong> While metaphorical pats on the back are necessary (and "
"encouraged!), the type of feedback that really push us to grow are "
"thoughtfully-formulated constructive criticisms."

"<strong>Giving constructive criticism (and receiving it) is something that "
"takes practice.</strong> We adhere to “<a "
"href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumper_(Bambi)\">if you can’t say "
"something nice, don’t say nothing at all</a>” because we don’t believe that "
"our opinions are necessary. We forget that criticism doesn’t have to lead to "
"complete redesign or reformulation. <strong>We also tend to spend time "
"focusing on our own things, rather than looking at other people’s ideas and "
"thinking about making them better.</strong> We ask for feedback and expect "
"to get some, but <strong>we rarely give our feedback freely</strong> – we "
"wait until our specific feedback is requested or until the work directly "
"affects our own."

"Giving feedback is an important part of collaboration, but there’s more to "

"collaborate in different ways, along multiple paths, just as they learn to "

"As we discussed last week, our roles as mentors are changing, and so are the "
"roles of learners and peers. <strong>These roles are fluid in maker and "
"remix pedagogies</strong>, and they’re fluid in spaces where community and "
"inquiry drive co-learning and making. As we discussed in “<a title=\"Week 4: "
"Add the Web to Anything\" href=\"http://hivenyc.org/teachtheweb/week-4-add-"
"the-web-to-anything/\">Add the Web to Anything</a>”, we have agency to "
"control our own experiences, which means we can experiment with our own "
"perception of the role we’re playing and even change that role. If one of us "
"has this agency, so do all of us, which means that <strong>we have to be "
